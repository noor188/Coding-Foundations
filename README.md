# Space Invaders Project

 The game have the following behaviour:

1. The tank should move right and left at the bottom of the screen when you press the arrow keys. If you press the left arrow key, it will continue to move left at a constant speed until you press the right arrow key.
2. The tank should fire missiles straight up from its current position when you press the space bar.
3. The invaders should appear randomly along the top of the screen and move at a 45 degree angle. When they hit a wall they will bounce off and continue at a 45 degree angle in the other direction.
