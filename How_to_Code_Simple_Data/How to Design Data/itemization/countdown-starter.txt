; PROBLEM:
; 
; Consider designing the system for controlling a New Year's Eve
; display. Design a data definition to represent the current state 
; of the countdown, which falls into one of three categories: 
; 
;  - not yet started
;  - from 10 to 1 seconds before midnight
;  - complete (Happy New Year!)
; 


;; countdown is one of:
;;  - false
;;  - Natural[1,10]
;;  - "complate"
;; interp.
;; false         means countdown has not yet started
;; Natural[1,10] means countdown is running and how many seconds left
;; "complete"    means countdown is over

(define cd1 false)      ; not yet started
(define cd2 10)          ; just started running
(define cd3 5)          ; midway 
(define cd4 1)          ; almost over
(define cd5 "complete" ); countdown is over

(define (fn-for-Countdown cd)
  (cond [ (false? cd) (...)]
        [ (and (number? cd)(<= 1 cd)(<= cd 10)) (... cd)]
        [ else (...)])
  )

;; template rules used :
;; - one of : 3 cases
;; - atomic distinct : false
;; - atomin non-distinct : interval
;; - atomic distinct : "complate"
