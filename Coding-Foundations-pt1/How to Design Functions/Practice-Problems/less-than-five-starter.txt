; 
; DESIGN function that consumes a string and determines whether its length is
; less than 5.  Follow the HtDF recipe and leave behind commented out versions 
; of the stub and template.
; 


;; String -> String
;; True if str length is less than 5
(check-expect (less-than-five? "Noor")         true)
(check-expect (less-than-five? "happy")        false)
(check-expect (less-than-five? "complicated")  false)

;(define (less-than-five? str) true) ; stub

;; <template used from Atomic non-distinct>
#; 
(define (fn-for-str str)
        (... str))

(define (less-than-five? str)
        (> 5 (string-length str) ))
