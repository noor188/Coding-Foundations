; PROBLEM:
; 
; Use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design a function that consumes an image, 
; and appears to put a box around it. Note that you can do this by creating an "outline" 
; rectangle that is bigger than the image, and then using overlay to put it on top of the image. 
; For example:
; 
; (boxify (ellipse 60 30 "solid" "red")) should produce .
; 
; Remember, when we say DESIGN, we mean follow the recipe.
; 
; Leave behind commented out versions of the stub and template.

;; Image -> Image
;; Produce an image with a box around it, the box is 5 pixels larger and wider than the img
(check-expect (boxify (ellipse 60 30 "solid" "red")) (overlay (ellipse 60 30 "solid" "red")
                                                              (rectangle 65 35 "outline" "black")))

;(define (boxify img) (ellipse 60 30 "solid" "red")); stub

(define (boxify img) ; template
  (overlay img (rectangle (+ (image-width img) 5)
                          (+ (image-height img) 5)
                          "outline"
                          "black")))
